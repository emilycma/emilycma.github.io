        Formula Society of Automotive Engineers challenges students to conceive, design, fabricate, and compete with small formula-style racing cars. 
        Teams spend 8-12 months designing, building, and preparing their vehicles for a competition.
        These cars are judged in a series of static and dynamic events, including technical inspection, cost, presentation, engineering design, 
        solo performance trials and high performance endurance.
        Washington University in St. Louis competes in the June Formula SAE internal combustion competition against 119 other teams.

         I modeled a chassis that complied with FSAE's rules on tube goemetries, bracing configurations, and template requirements (noted in Structural Equivalency Spreadsheet). 
         I worked around the aero system's existing molds, powertrain's chosen 
         engine and serviceability requirements, ergo's pedal box design, suspension's anti-roll bar configuration, and other external system requirements.
        With every chassis node as possible, I made them at a triangulated point ideally with frame members at a similar angle to the maximum force. 
        Then the system was focused on observing how small changes in node location, tube triangulation, and tube geometry could increase stiffness 
        so we could optimize any weight increase.

          manufacturing // <p style="all:unset; font-weight:400"></p>
        </div> 
        <div>My co-lead and I worked with a precision tube manufacturer in Canada to order tube kits for the frame. 
          
          I prepared the individual CAD files, technical drawings, material list for tube bending and notching. Critical dimensions were called out and communicated for the pedal box rails and the three engine mounts. 
          <!--As the team was still not allowed into the garage for COVID guidance policies, we decided to have VR3 
          weld the frame rather than order a second tube kit for a frame jig and meet with a local welder.-->

          torsional stiffness simulation // <p style="all:unset; font-weight:400"></p>
        </div> 
        <div>The needs of the other systems were balanced with the primary goals of the chassis sytem, the frame 
          should be stiff and lightweight.
          The predominant metric was torsional stiffness, relevant when going over bump or cornering.

          Keeping with the overall design goal of drivability, the focus on torsional stiffness was to allow 
          for a predictable response to suspension adjustments. 
          We adapted an existing structural analyzer MATLAB script which utilized the direct stiffness method.
          Over 95 simulations were run with various geometry and thickness iterations within this script,  
          and minimizing deflections at suspension nodes. Inputs included node locations, tube connections, 
          specific tube geometries and thicknesses, material properties, degrees of freedom for each node, and the loads.

          physical testing // <p style="all:unset; font-weight:400"></p>
        </div> 
        <div>
          
          To validate the results from the MATLAB FEM, we perform physical testing to calculate the torsional stiffness of the chassis. 
          The constraints of the physical testing rig are as similar to the MATLAB script as possible.
          The rear suspension A-arm plane was fixed to a stationary I-beam at the hubs, and the front suspension A-arm plane 
          is loaded and allowed to pivot about centerline of the frame â€” deflections are measured.

          A jack was placed on a scale, allowing measurement of the load the jack is exerting on the front I-beam as it is torquing the front of the frame. 
          <br/><br/>
            Laser pointers were attached to nodes of the frame, suspension box and side impact structure points, and projected onto a flat backboard 
          a measured distance away. The locations of the laser pointers 
          were recorded for each preload and subsequent load measured. 

          <br/><br/>
          Using the displacements, loads, and measured distances to each of the nodes, torsional stiffness was calculated.
          Torsional stiffness CT is calculated as the ratio between applied torque T and the angle of deformation alpha. 
          This was repeated for ten total trials. The results showed that the discrepancy 
          between predicted and actual torsional stiffness values could be accounted by an uncertainty of plus or 
          minus 79 Nm/deg, validating our MATLAB simulation.

          tab jigs and welding // <p style="all:unset; font-weight:400"></p>
        </div> 
        <div>There are over 100 tabs on the frame that need to be positioned properly for tig welding. The chassis system is responsible for
           tracking down each system's requirements for each tab, modeling the jig required to position the tab, and manufacturing of the jigs.
           Many of the jigs associated with tabs that had loose tolerancing requirements could be printed on Prusas. Tabs that held critcal dimensions
           (suspension arms, pedal box) used aluminum to maintain spacing between the lug.

           Suspension tabs are sized to have positive margin for bolt, bushing, and bearing failure using maximum loads from the suspension system.

           The tabs are waterjet, the undersized holes are drilled out and edges are ground down to prepare for welding.

          I stepped back to a non-technical executive role my senior year. I interfaced with university contacts, fundraising 
          initiatives, and local reporters. Along with the rest of the executive members, I interviewed prospective new members, emphasizing effort 
          and willingness to learn over inate talent.  I assumed an advisory role for the chassis system. I printed all required jigs, aero molds, and hardware. 
          I wrote simple programs that improved team efficiency in required CAD documentation. I designed and wrapped the car with the engineering technical lead!!
