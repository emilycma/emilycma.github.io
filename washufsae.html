        Formula Society of Automotive Engineers challenges students to conceive, design, fabricate, and compete with small formula-style racing cars. 
        Teams spend 8-12 months designing, building, and preparing their vehicles for a competition.
        These cars are judged in a series of static and dynamic events, including technical inspection, cost, presentation, engineering design, 
        solo performance trials and high performance endurance.
        Washington University in St. Louis competes in the June Formula SAE internal combustion competition against 119 other teams.

            almost entirely virtually as we did not have access to our garage.

 First we focused on creating a rule compliant chassis that met the needs of the other systems. With every chassis node as possible, we made them at a triangulated point ideally with frame members at a similar angle to the force. Then our focus was on observing how small changes in node location and tube triangulation could increase stiffness so we could optimize any weight increase.

          manufacturing // <p style="all:unset; font-weight:400"></p>
        </div> 
        <div>I worked with a precision tube manufacturer in Canada to order tube kits for the frame. 
          
          I prepared the CAD files, drawings, material list. Critical dimensions were called out for the pedal box rails and the three engine mounts. 

          As the team was still not allowed into the garage for COVID guidance policies, we decided to have VR3 
          weld the frame rather than order a second tube kit for a frame jig and meet with a local welder.</div>

          torsional stiffness simulation // <p style="all:unset; font-weight:400"></p>
        </div> 
        <div>The needs of the other systems were balanced with the primary goals of the chassis sytem, the frame should be stiff and lightweight.
          The predominant metric was torsional stiffness, relevant when going over bump or cornering
        
        
          The chassis design process was centered around torsional stiffness MatLab calculator that could accurately predict torsional stiffness and also be utilized for analysis of loads at suspension nodes. Keeping with the overall design goal of drivability, the focus on torsional stiffness was to allow for a predictable response to suspension adjustments. 
          We adapted “MatLab Structural Analyser”, which utilizes the direct stiffness method, for our  frame and then implemented a genetic algorithm to optimize both geometry and thickness. Over 95 simulations were run with various geometry and thickness iterations within that simulation,  and minimizing deflections at suspension nodes. This simulation took in the node locations, tube connections, specific tube geometries and thicknesses, and the loads.250 lbs/node.

        </div> 
        <div>Physical testing procedures are required to ensure the validity of the torsional stiffness MATLAB FEM. 
          The constraints and loads of the model were validated using a test rig and a frame from a past design, which was physically tested in various states (engine in, engine out). The results of the tests showed that the discrepancy between predicted and actual torsional stiffness values could be accounted for by a constant factor, about plus or minus 79 NM/deg.

          tab jigs and welding // <p style="all:unset; font-weight:400"></p>
        </div> 
        <div>There are over 100 tabs on the frame that need to be positioned properly for tig welding. The chassis system is responsible for
           tracking down each system's requirements for each tab, modeling the jig required to position the tab, and manufacturing of the jigs.
           Many of the jigs associated with tabs that had loose tolerancing requirements could be printed on Prusas. Tabs that held critcal dimensions
           (suspension arms, pedal box) used aluminum to maintain spacing between the lug.

           Suspension tabs are sized to have positive margin for bolt, bushing, and bearing failure using maximum loads from the suspension system.

           The tabs are waterjet, the undersized holes are drilled out and edges are ground down to prepare for welding.

          I stepped back to a non-technical executive role my senior year on the team. I interfaced with team sponsors, university contacts, fundraising 
          initiatives, local reporters, and alumni. Along with the rest of the executive members, I interviewed prospective new members, emphasizing effort 
          and willingness to learn over inate talent.  I assumed an advisory role for the chassis system. I printed all required jigs, aero molds, and required hardware. I also 
          designed* and wrapped the car!
