        The goal of this project was to create a jewelry box mimicking the form of a large mahjong tile. 
        The main challenge was achieving an acceptable interference fit, 
        mimicking woodworking joint techniques, with milled 6061 aluminum plates. Although 
        the knockback associated with a manual mill made joining pieces unpredictable 
        (read: many trips between the arbor press and many, many different vices), a continuous 
        box was constructed without the need for fasteners or hot joining methods. After joining, 
        facing each side with a shell endmill and corner rounding the edges made the joints  
        nearly invisible.
        <br/><br/>
        The top of the box features my family name in my mother’s handwriting, sandcast from 
        aluminum, which produced a soft, organic domed finish.

    <p class="personalproject-caption">The lid is composed of multiple layers of solid laser cut walnut sandwiched around a cast aluminum character and a laser cut aluminum panel.
      The free pattern, gate, and runner are printed from PLA, sanded, and coated in shellac. Test pulls were done to ensure the incline of 7 degrees 
    would maintain the smaller pockets of the pattern in the oil-based sand. Aluminum components were sanded and polished at 1600 grit.  </p>

    <p class="personalproject-caption"> The box is composed of 5 aluminum pieces held together with friction fit joints.
      Waterjetting was explored to cut out the walls, but the tolerance was not tight enough to maintain consistent widths of each finger. 
      As a (much more time-intensive) alternative, the manual mill was used to square up the stock, and a 1/2" flat endmill was used to mill out each of the pockets, with the intention of creating
      2 thou of interference. 
      <br></br>
      The exterior was taped off and bead blasted to shown a pattern. Although there was significantly easier fabrication methods to
      create a similar vessel (sheet metal bending, welding, riveting, brazing), the concept of using woodworking techniques with a significantly harder
      material was an interesting challenge. </p>
