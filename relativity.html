        Relativity Space launched its first vehicle, Terran I. It made waves because it was the largest 3D printed structure, over 85% printed.

        The newest 
        Terran R is

            Terran R is a multistage rocket. Stage separation occurs once the vehicle reaches initial parking orbit. I was responsible for 
            the initial design scoping of the stage 2 separation bracket, intended to fly with Terran R in 2026.

            I cannot disclose design, methodology, or quantitative analysis to protect Relativity's intellectual property. 
            Details have been kept purposely vague to avoid any unintentional disclosure of proprietary information.

            I collected requirements from every relevant system and presented to stakeholders.
            These requirements informed my intial design and sizing. Further sizing was completed with finite element software. This all culminated
             in a final review of my analysis. The results presented will influence many aspects of the critical design review for this component and relevant 
            
            I defended my design decisions with FEM stress plots, bolt bush forces, lug and bolted joint margin calculations, 
            I was the lead of these design meetings, and I was the responsible engineer for this component. 

            

            <br/><br/>
            I am extremely thankful to my mentor for his guidance, knowledge, and support while giving me freedom to own my design and analysis decisions. 
            I was uncertain with my placement on the structures team; my previous structures work was in undergrad, but most of my graduate program focused
            on materials analysis, manufacturing, and product realization. However, I enjoyed this internship immensely, and I learned a huge host of new software and analysis procedures 
            in a short period of time. I am lucky to gain exposure to an aerospace company through work on such a high criticality component.
