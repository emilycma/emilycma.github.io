        Relativity Space built and launched the world’s first 3D printed rocket (85%), Terran 1, and is now bringing to market Terran R, their reusable medium-to-heavy-lift launch vehicle. 
        Their focus on iterative development approach revolutionizes the process from design to flight, ensuring scalability to meet customer needs.
        The focus is to provide exceptional launch services that are highly competitive in the market. 
        Relativty Space aims to design and manufacture cost-effective, high-performance, and reusable rockets at an unprecedented pace and scale – setting a new industry standard.

            Stage Separation Bracket // <p style="all:unset; font-weight:400;font-size:15px;">stage 2 vehicle structures, 2024</p>

            To protect Relativity's intellectual property, I cannot disclose design, methodology, or quantitative analysis. 
            Details have been kept purposely vague to avoid any unintentional disclosure of proprietary information. Terran R is a multistage rocket. Stage separation occurs once the vehicle reaches initial parking orbit. I was responsible for 
            the initial design scoping of the stage 2 separation bracket, intended to fly with Terran R in 2026. 

            I collected requirements from every relevant system and presented to stakeholders.
            These requirements informed my intial design and sizing. Further sizing was completed with finite element software. This all culminated
             in a final review of my analysis. The results presented will influence many aspects of the critical design review for this component and relevant 
            
            I defended my design decisions with FEM stress plots, bolt bush forces, lug and bolted joint margin calculations, 
            I was the lead of these design meetings, and I was the responsible engineer for this component. 

            

            <br/><br/>
            I am extremely thankful to my mentor for his guidance, knowledge, and support while giving me freedom to own my design and analysis decisions. 
            I was uncertain with my placement on the structures team; most of my graduate program focused
            on materials analysis and manufacturing. However, I enjoyed this internship immensely, and I learned a huge host of new software and analysis procedures 
            in a short period of time. I am lucky to gain exposure to an aerospace company through work on such a high criticality component.
