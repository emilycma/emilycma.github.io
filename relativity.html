            Stage Separation Bracket // <p style="all:unset; font-weight:400;font-size:15px;">stage 2 vehicle structures, 2024</p>

            Terran R is a multistage rocket. Stage separation occurs once the vehicle reaches initial parking orbit. I was responsible for 
            the initial design scoping of the stage 2 separation bracket, intended to fly with Terran R in 2026. 

            I collected requirements from relevant systems and presented to stakeholders.
            These requirements informed my intial design and sizing. Further sizing was completed with finite element software. This culminated
             in a final review of my analysis. The results presented will be recapitulated in the critical design review for this component. 
            
            I defended my design decisions with FEM stress plots, bolt bush forces, lug and bolted joint margin calculations, 
            I was the lead of these design meetings, and I was the responsible engineer for this component. 

            

            <br/><br/>
            I am thankful to my mentor for his guidance, knowledge, and support while giving me freedom to own my design and analysis decisions.
